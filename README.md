# Linear Regression from Scratch
I built this simple Linear Regression model to learn how Gradient Descent works under the hood.
my work:
* I Generated a dummy dataset with a linear trend.
* I Wrote my own functions for the **Cost Function** and **Gradients** using `for` loops.
* And Trained the model over 10,000 iterations to find the best fit for w and b.
I used:
* Python
* NumPy -for math
* Matplotlib -to plot the data and the error curve
